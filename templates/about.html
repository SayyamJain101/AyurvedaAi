    <h2>History & Origins</h2>
    <div class="grid">
        <div class="card">
            <h3>📚 Ancient Roots</h3>
            <p>Ayurveda emerged in India over 5,000 years ago, mentioned in the Vedas - the oldest sacred texts. The word "Ayurveda" comes from Sanskrit: "Ayur" (life) + "Veda" (science/knowledge), literally meaning "the science of life."</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>🏛️ Classical Development</h3>
            <p>The great physicians Charaka, Sushruta, and Vagbhata systematized Ayurveda between 1500-1000 BCE. Their texts remain foundational, detailing anatomy, pharmacology, surgery, and treatment protocols still used today.</p>
        </div>

            <h3>🌍 Global Recognition</h3>

<!-- Core Principles -->
<section>
    <h2>Core Principles of Ayurveda</h2>
    <div class="grid">
        <div class="card">
            <h3>🔄 Balance is Health</h3>
            <p>Health results from balanced doshas, digestive fire, and harmonious body-mind-spirit. Disease emerges from dosha imbalance. Treatment restores equilibrium through diet, lifestyle, and therapies.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>🌿 Nature is Medicine</h3>
            <p>Ayurveda uses natural substances - herbs, spices, oils, and minerals. Over 8,000 medicinal plants are catalogued in Ayurvedic literature. These work with your body's intelligence rather than against it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>🎯 Prevention First</h3>
            <p>Ayurveda emphasizes prevention through proper diet, lifestyle, and seasonal adjustments. Prevention is always superior to treatment, reducing the need for interventions later.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>👤 Individual Constitution</h3>
            <p>Each person has a unique Prakriti (constitution) - their natural dosha balance. Treatments are personalized based on constitution, not standardized for everyone.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>🧠 Mind-Body Unity</h3>
            <p>Physical health depends on mental and emotional well-being. Thoughts, emotions, and consciousness directly influence body and health. Holistic healing addresses all dimensions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>⚡ Agni is Life</h3>
            <p>"Agni" (digestive fire) is the foundation of health. Strong digestion prevents disease. Maintaining agni through proper eating and lifestyle is crucial for longevity and vitality.</p>
