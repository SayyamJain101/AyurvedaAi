## 🔐 IMPORTANT REMINDERS

### API Key Security

- **STORE IT:** In `.env` file (NEVER in code)
- **PROTECT IT:** Don't share, don't commit to git
- **USE IT:** Set in environment before running app

### Files to Create

- **Create:** `.env` file (copy from `.env.example`)
- **Add:** `GROQ_API_KEY=your_actual_key`
